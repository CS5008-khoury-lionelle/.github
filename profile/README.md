## Team Activities 

[Team activities](https://github.com/CS5008-khoury-lionelle/TeamActivities) are labs designed to be peer led. 


## Midterm and Final
Both the [midterm](https://github.com/CS5008-khoury-lionelle/MidtermOptionFib) and the [final](https://github.com/CS5008-khoury-lionelle/FinalResearchPaper) are projects. The midterm is comparative analysis of an algorithm using two languages, while the final is a research paper. We also run mock interviews during / before finals week for students, to contribute to their final grade - depending on the semester.


## Homeworks

The following are the homeworks for the course. They are in the middle of transition from calling them "hw01" to more descriptive names, as it allows moving around the modules easier. There is an instructor autograder setup for grading half the homework, and the remainder is
manually graded written work. 

Homeworks are in the pattern of every two weeks, except for the first week which is only a week homework. This puts them due every odd week of the semester. 

Homeworks are currently public templates as that is what Github classroom required before their July 2024 change. They have yet to be updated.
